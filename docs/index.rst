Welcome to fv3net's documentation!
==================================

To get running quickly, see our :ref:`quickstarts`. These contain information about installation/setup, as well as how you can run pre-configured examples.

The :ref:`workflows` page documents our overall scientific workflow, with links to documentation for each component.

:ref:`packages` describes the tools and libraries we use to organize our code.

If you run into issues, you may want to check the :ref:`FAQs` to see if this is a known issue we have a solution for.

We track our internal experiments in this `dropbox paper document <https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/ML-skill-for-FV3-GFS-rcRyq37aoDiWOtYMVchW9>`_. Available datasets can also be seen in the `intake catalog <https://github.com/VulcanClimateModeling/fv3net/blob/master/external/vcm/vcm/catalog.yaml>`_. These resources are both private and available internally.
